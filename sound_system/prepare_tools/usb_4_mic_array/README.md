The ReSpeaker USB 4 Mic Array is the successor of the ReSpeaker USB 6+1 Mic Array. It has better built-in audio processing algorithms than the 6+1 Mic Array, so it has better audio recording quality, although it only has 4 microphones.

## Features
+ 4 microphones
+ 12 RGB LEDs
+ USB
+ built-in AEC, VAD, DOA, Beamforming and NS
+ 16000 sample rate

## Usage
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is recommended to test audio recording.

## Install DFU and LED control driver for Windows
On Linux and macOS, the USB 4 Mic Array will just work. On Windows, audio recording and playback will also work without installing a driver. But in order to upgrade the device's firmware or to control LEDs an DSP parameters on Windows, the libusb-win32 driver is required. We use [a handy tool - Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to install the libusb-win32 driver for both `SEEED DFU` and `SEEED Control` (the USB 4 Mic Array has 4 devices on Windows Device Manager).

>Make sure that libusb-win32 is selected, not WinUSB or libusbK

## Device Firmware Update
The Microphone Array supports USB DFU. We have [a python script - dfu.py](https://github.com/respeaker/mic_array_dfu/blob/master/dfu.py) to do that.

```
pip install pyusb
python dfu.py --download new_firmware.bin       #  with sudo if usb permission error
```

| firmware | channels | note |
|---------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1_channel_firmware.bin | 1 | processed audio for ASR |
| 6_channels_firmware.bin | 6 | channel 0: processed audio for ASR, channel 1-4: 4 microphones' raw data, channel 5: playback |
| 6_channels_firmware_6.02dB.bin | 6 | same as 6_channels_firmware.bin, but 4 microphones have a 6.02dB gain  |
| 6_channels_firmware_12.04dB.bin | 6 | same as 6_channels_firmware.bin, but 4 microphones have a 12.04dB gain  |
| 48k_1_channels_firmware.bin | 1 | 48k sample rate, 1 input channel |
| 48k_6_channels_firmware_6.02dB.bin | 6 | s48k sample rate, 1 input channel, 6.02dB gain  |


## How to control the RGB LED ring
The USB 4 Mic Array has on-board 12 RGB LEDs and has a variety of light effects. Go to the [respeaker/pixel_ring](https://github.com/respeaker/pixel_ring) to learn how to use it. The LED control protocol is at [respeaker/pixel_ring wiki](https://github.com/respeaker/pixel_ring/wiki/ReSpeaker-USB-4-Mic-Array-LED-Control-Protocol).


## Tuning
There are some parameters of built-in algorithms to configure. For example, we can turn off Automatic Gain Control (AGC):

```
python tuning.py AGCONOFF 0i6_firmware.bin
```

To get the full list parameters, run:

```
python tuning.py -p
```

## Realtime sound source localization and tracking
[ODAS](https://github.com/introlab/odas) is a very cool project to perform sound source localization, tracking, separation and post-filtering. Let's have a try!

1. get ODAS and build it

```
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libconfig-dev libasound2-dev
git clone https://github.com/introlab/odas.git --branch=dev
mkdir odas/build
cd odas/build
cmake ..
make
```

2. get ODAS Studio from https://github.com/introlab/odas_web/releases and open it.

The `odascore` will be at `odas/bin/odascore`, the config file is at [odas.cfg](odas.cfg). Change `odas.cfg` based on your sound card number.


```
    interface: {
        type = "soundcard";
        card = 1;
        device = 0;
    }
```

3. upgrade your usb 4 mic array with [6_channels_firmware_6.02dB.bin](6_channels_firmware_6.02dB.bin) (or 6_channels_firmware.bin, 6_channels_firmware_12.04dB.bin) which includes 4 channels raw audio data.
